# Test Hurley Website
The code in this repository uses php instead of HTML for majority of the files for its reusability and scalability. Additionally a large addition to this is the ability to use the backend directly with the code to make the user login and creation much easier.

# The Website Structure
A huge benefit of using php is that we can include html files in the document, meaning that the header and footer can be saved in an seperate document with its own css and script hardcoded in. This makes any changes to the header affect all of the subsequent documents and makes it much easier to impliment the header and footer in the rest of the website.
